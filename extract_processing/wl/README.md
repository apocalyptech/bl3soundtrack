Wonderlands versions of my audio-wrangling scripts.  Very little is different
from the BL3 versions, but it's enough that I figured separating them out made
sense.

Some brief summaries:

* `wwiser-all.sh` - Runs [wwiser](https://github.com/bnnm/wwiser) against the
  collection of `.bnk` files in the current dir, which generates
  [TXTP](https://github.com/vgmstream/vgmstream/blob/master/doc/TXTP.md) files
  for use with [vgmstream](https://vgmstream.org/).  Make sure you've got
  [this name-suggestion file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bnnm/wwiser-utils/master/wwnames/Tiny%20Tina%27s%20Wonderlands%20%28PC%29.txt)
  ([local mirror](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apocalyptech/bl3soundtrack/main/wwnames/Tiny%20Tina%27s%20Wonderlands%20%28PC%29.txt))
  in the current dir with the name `wwnames.txt`, so that the TXTP files are
  named sensibly.
* `hash_to_name.txt` - A text file I can use for quick lookups of what
  wem/bnk numbers map to which known names.  Generated by running a `select`
  against the SQLite DB that wwiser can generate after matching names to
  numbers.
* `categorize.py` - After generating the TXTPs, you're left with a single
  dir with thousands of files in it.  This util categorizes them into some
  subdirs for easier browsing.
* `link_external_vos.py` - A bunch of voiceover-related `.bnk` banks are
  used to trigger arbitrary dialog which is chosen at runtime, so wwiser
  can't generate full TXTPs for those.  This util uses my
  [wldata Python library](https://github.com/BLCM/wlmods/tree/master/python_mod_helpers)
  to find associations to those WEM files, and writes out a series of TXTPs
  for the matches that it finds.  Basically only useful inside the `vo`
  directory that `categorize.py` sets up.
* `find_unmapped_wem.py` - Attempts to identify WEM files which are not
  referenced in any TXTP files.
* `play_unmapped.py` - A little script to loop through the results of
  `find_unmapped_wem.py` and play each file, to help categorize them.

BL3 versions of these utils can be found in the parent directory.
