find_unmapped_wem.py generates a list of .wem files in our audio
extracts which we don't actually reference in any of our .txtps.
I'd sorted that by size and started at the big ones and worked
my way down -- the size drops off pretty quickly, and in the end
it looked like there was just a few tracks which might merit
inclusion on an "extras" soundtrack.  There's presumably bits
and bobs of other music in the ones I didn't listen to, but the
sizes were getting low enough that everything was pretty minor.

Actual music, not used (yet?):
------------------------------

1065626570.wem - Very moody and atmospheric - DLC3-related
    - Not really worth soundtracking on its own, though, without anything
      else to attach it to.
511865345.wem - Real crunchy exciting electronic opening, base-game.
574991506.wem - Continuation of 511865345
    - These two are quite nice, but without anything to attach to, not sure
      what I'd do with 'em

Actual music, already queued up for soundtrack extension inclusion:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

915321961.wem - Moody piano thing -- DLC3-related.
    - Very nice, actually; I may want to keep this.  Almost certainly
      Raison Varner.  Definitely not in the official soundtrack.
980319067.wem - Another version of the Citizen Science chiptunes tune
    - "deeper" sounding overall; has a nice bassline through a lot of it.
      Might prefer this to the other one.  (And indeed, yeah, I've flipped
      over my soundtrack extension to use this instead)

Not really music per se:
------------------------

296553770.wem - More backmasking
32683506.wem - Watery sounding ambiance
51420086.wem - Menacing synth stuff
873391502.wem - Some backmasked stuff
459124174.wem - Fast Travel sfx
925155728.wem - Dramatic sting
