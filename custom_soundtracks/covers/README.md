BL3 Unofficial Soundtrack Covers
================================

This is a [gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) project I'd used to generate
some album covers for the unofficial BL3 soundtrack extensions I've
been creating for personal use.  It makes use of the 'Countach' font,
so make sure you've got that.

To generate the shadows around the soundtrack text, I'd used the
"Drop Shadow" filter, with the following settings:

    x/y: 0
    blur radius: 10
    Circle
    Grow radius: 12
    Opacity: 2
    Clipping: Adjust
    Mode: Replace (or Normal, doesn't seem to matter)
    Opacity: 100
