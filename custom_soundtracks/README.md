Unofficial Borderlands 3 Soundtrack Extensions
==============================================

This dir contains info about the various unofficial BL3 soundtrack extensions
that I've put together for my own purposes.  Note that there's no actual
sound data in here at all -- to make use of any of this info you'll have to
extract the BL3 audio data yourself, and in some cases download/purchase some
extra music online as well.  Note too that the soundtrack construction was
done entirely in Linux, and there's a lot of commandline processing going on
in here.

1. **Songs** - This is a soundtrack which collects all intro/outro cinematic
   songs, songs from credits, and a few other examples of licensed music
   (with lyrics) throughout the game.  This does *not* include any Crimson
   Radio tracks, and by and large omits any instrumentals (though there are
   a couple of exceptions).  About 1 hour long, and 20 tracks.
2. **Extras** - "Symphonic" type music found in the data which doesn't appear
   on the official soundtracks.  This includes fair bit of licensed music as
   well, but it's all instrumental.  About 2 hours long, and 39 tracks.
3. **Crimson Radio** - As the name would suggest, this is all the musical
   Crimson Radio bits.  About 5 hours long, and 66 tracks.
4. **Carnivora Festival** - When going into Carnivora, the player gets a
   random selection from a pool of eleven tracks, all very carnival-esque.
   These are those tracks.  Just 26min long!

The `covers` dir also contains the album covers I used for 'em.

Between these four soundtracks plus the official game soundtracks, I believe
that just about includes practically all music in the game.  There's almost
certainly bits of music throughout the data, as smallish parts of larger
tracks, which aren't represented, but I'm personally quite satisfied.  There's
a couple of omissions:

1. Aeternam's "Praetor of Mercury," which plays as part of the Digby Vermouth
   quests in DLC1.  That should really be in the "Songs" soundtrack, but I'd
   overlooked it and don't care enough to try and fit it back in.
2. Moxxi's Bar music in Lectra City is exactly the BL1 Soundtrack Raison Varner's
   "Welcome To The Arena Suckers" -- since that's already on the BL1
   Soundtrack (at least the digital versions), that's omitted.
3. Some "demo" music turned out to be the Saturn fight music from BL2,
   presumably just in the data as placeholders while the game was being
   built.
4. A few little bits and bobs didn't seem worth putting in.  Zahnzi's
   game show music, for instance.  There's a *lot* of ambient strings
   from DLC3 which are nice but not really soundtrack-worthy on their
   own.  Stuff like that.
