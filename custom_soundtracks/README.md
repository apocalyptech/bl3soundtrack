Unofficial Borderlands 3 Soundtrack Extensions
==============================================

This dir contains info about the various unofficial BL3 soundtrack extensions
that I've put together for my own purposes.  Note that there's no actual
sound data in here at all -- to make use of any of this info you'll have to
extract the BL3 audio data yourself, and in some cases download/purchase some
extra music online as well.  Note too that the soundtrack construction was
done entirely in Linux, and there's a lot of commandline processing going on
in here.

1. **Songs** - This is a soundtrack which collects all intro/outro cinematic
   songs, songs from credits, and a few other examples of licensed music
   (with lyrics) throughout the game.  This does *not* include any Crimson
   Radio tracks, and by and large omits any instrumentals (though there are
   a couple of exceptions).  About 1 hour long, and 20 tracks.
2. **Extras** - "Symphonic" type music found in the data which doesn't appear
   on the official soundtracks.  This includes fair bit of licensed music as
   well, but it's all instrumental.  About 2 hours long, and 39 tracks.
3. **Crimson Radio** - As the name would suggest, this is all the musical
   Crimson Radio bits.  About 5 hours long, and 66 tracks.

The `covers` dir also contains the album covers I used for 'em.
