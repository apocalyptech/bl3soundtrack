Borderlands 3: Carnivora Festival (unofficial)
==============================================

When the player enters Carnivora, a random track will play from a selection
of eleven.  They range from 30 seconds to 7 minutes long, and they're all
quite carnival-like.  The in-game audio is also pre-processed to introduce
a lot of distortion and noise, so they don't sound great.  For this one
I'd ended up just pulling the mp3 preview streams from the music-licensing
sites and used that.  It's not super listenable otherwise.

Relatively little care was taken with the sequencing here; I just went
through it once and it seemed Good Enough for something I'm unlikely to
listen to more than once.  Still!  This is the last of the four that I've
put together, and I believe it basically rounds out the soundtrack
completely.

For construction, I did make use of the `do_tags.py` and `do_order.py`
scripts from my Extras soundtrack, using the couple of text files in
here for data.

Here's the order I went with:

1. Denis Hawksworth / Merry Go Round (30)
2. Niklas Edberger / House of Fun
3. Roger Roger / Magic Fairground No. 1
4. Rolf Eriksson / Big Top
5. Niklas Edberger and Anders Kampe / Pigalle
6. Roger James Limb / On the Carousel (30)
7. Harry Gordon Forbes / Switchback
8. Roger Roger / Magic Fairground No. 2
9. Eric Allen / Dance of the Pipes
10. Johann Strauss (arr. Carl S Zittrer) / Blue Danube Waltz
11. Niklas Edberger and Anders Kampe / Thunderpants
