Music-related TXTP files which seem to *not* appear on the official
soundtracks.  (Specifically ones which seem official-soundtrack-worthy,
so *not* Crimson Radio or other "real" band songs.)

Mus_Motorcade_Interior-0237-event
Finishing Move Inc., possibly / Agonizer 9000 Commercial Break
Just some chipper bouncy commercial-type music.  First is 30secs; second is 1:15,
though it sounds just like it's the same thing looped.

'Mus_Bar_Start (Mus_Hibiscus_Bar=Mus_Bar_DarkMix).txtp'
Raison Varner / Dark Mix (confirmed musician+trackname from Varner's soundcloud)

Raison Varner, possibly / Citizen Science
Citizen Science machine chiptunes.  The two cues reference what's
probably the actual in-game audio, but there's also what looks like
an unreferenced wem with *better* audio in the game data.  This
maybe gets called dynamically from somewhere, but it's a much nicer-
sounding source, for inclusion into a soundtrack extension.

Sort of muzak, apparently tied to Meridian Metroplex.  Processed so it sounds like it's
coming out of a pretty tinny speaker; honestly probably not super worth putting in
on an unofficial sountrack expansion.

'Mus_City_Vault_Boss_Play (Mus_Scripted_City_Vault_Boss=Phase_01).txtp'
Michael McCann, possibly / The Rampager Emerges / Graveward Guardian Fake-Out
Part of the Rampager's music, but doesn't show up in the soundtracks.  As a
fun note, this and the `Mus_Wetlands_Vault_EdenBoss_Fake_On` track share
some DNA, and even have almost identical-sounding endings.  I'm pretty sure
that the other one is sort of a continuation of this, and that they're both
probably McCann tracks (even though the other one's from Eden-6).

'Mus_Crater_CIN_Rose_Start (Mus_Geranium_Crater_Boss=Ruiner_Intro).txtp'
Mus_CraterBoss_Ambiance.txtp
Apparently from the cinematics (and then just general ambience) around the Ruiner
fight at the end of DLC3.  Not actually in the OST, though.  They're both
pretty short (42sec and 53 sec respectively).  The Rose one works well as
an intro to the Rose fight music below -- the Ruiner one is nice too, but
I've got nothing to attach it to.

Michael McCann, possibly / Killavolt (demo) / The Rave Cave
As the names suggest, this is probably leftover music from something demoy?
They're referenced from the Cathedral of the Twin Gods audio object, but
presumably just in error.  The "ambient" one isn't too interesting, but there's
some pretty good stuff in the "phase" ones.  NOTE: The "ending" to this
contains `Mus_Motorcade_RaveCave` in its entirety.  They must've taken this
demo and repurposed it for the Rave Cave segment at some point.  I've got
this down as being McCann, which would make sense for a Promethea/Athenas
track, though I don't really have a lot of supporting evidence (though it
doesn't sound dissimilar from other McCann tracks).

As the names suggest, this is probably leftover music from something demoy?
They're referenced from the Cathedral of the Twin Gods audio object, but

interesting on its own, really, but it's a nice lead-in to section 1,
which is subtle and rather fun.

Really loud overdriven drums; is *not* present in the Bloodsun Canyon OST
track.  Two .wems layered -- the "bottom" one is basically just extra
distortion, but the top track is still rather overdriven itself.  Not
a lot going on musically either, gonna skip it for soundtracks.

mixed in at some point too.  They're quite nice, though not really

Julian Peterson, possibly / Blastplains Tension
Blastplains combat music -- each one is pretty similar, honestly.  To
soundtrack we'll need to cut out quite a lot, and even then it'll be a
little repetetive.  It's not bad, but unsurprising it didn't make the OST
cut.

'Mus_FrostSite_BrassChoir_Play {r}.txtp'
'Mus_FrostSite_Metals_Play {r}.txtp'

is like 30 seconds)

Music in Moxxi's Bar in Lectra City.  The two are basically identical except
the second is processed to sound like it's coming out of a small speaker
somewhere.  Turns out this is basically Raison Varner's "Welcome to the
Arena Suckers" from at least the digital versions of the Borderlands 1 OST:

'Mus_Lodge_Start (Mus_System_Sections=Mus_Section_01)(Mus_System_Parts=Mus_Part_00) {s} {r}.txtp'
Raison Varner, possibly / Ashfall Peaks Unease
Some extra Ashfall Peak music.  This is only a 20-second loop, but there
*is* a lot of variation, and it's pretty great when strung together.  Bits
of this *are* used in the OST Ashfall Peak track, but soundtracking it with
a forced-random count of 5 makes for a pretty awesome track.  I actually
really like how it fades out, too...

Michael McCann, possibly / Killavolt (demo) / The Rave Cave
The Tink "rave" music during the Homestead side missions.  The second is a
processed version of the first which just sounds distorted, further away,
and from a shittier speaker.  They're pretty short, but if you remove the
time restrictions in the TXTP, ther raw .wem is long enough to warrant
inclusion, IMO.  NOTE: This song is contained in its entirety in the
`Mus_Demo_VS_Scripted_Start` tracks; I'm guessing that the original
Killavolt fight music demo got repurposed into the Rave Cave segment.
I've got these down as being McCann, which seems appropriate.

Finishing Move Inc., possibly / Splinterlands Ambiance
Finishing Move Inc., possibly / Splinterlands Combat
Splinterlands music.  This seems to just be absent from the soundtracks entirely?
Could be I missed something.

'Mus_Orbital_Claptrap_Dubstep_Start (Mus_Scripted_Orbital_Claptrap=Claptrap_Dubstep_On).txtp'
Chipper dancey track; actually not super dubsteppy for the most part.  Honestly
don't remember where this shows up in the game?  In Skywell-27, theoretically.
Turns out this is: Ilana Tarutina, Jeffrey Fayman, and Yoav Goren / Pink Ferrari

'Mus_Orbital_Digby_Start (Mus_Scripted_Orbital_Platform=Digby_On).txtp'
Track that Rhys Ball puts on during that Katagawa Ball fight.

'Mus_Orbital_Digby_Start (Mus_Scripted_Orbital_Platform=Digby_On).txtp'
Duplicate of Supernova Dreamsicle (which *is* on the official soundtracks),
mixed a little differently (sounds a bit boomier, as if being played on
some speakers in a room).

'Mus_Prologue-0534-event (Mus_System_Sections=Mus_Section_00).txtp'
This is "Welcome to Fyrestone" by Jesper Kyd, all the way from back to BL1.

'Mus_Prologue-0534-event (Mus_System_Sections=Mus_Section_01).txtp'
This is actually part of the Saturn fight from BL2

Michael McCann, possibly / Droughts - Section 3
More Droughts music -- not in the official soundtracks.

Mus_RumbleInJungle_KingBobo_TribalDrums_Layered.txtp
Drumming, clearly from the Rumble in the Jungle quest, and probably from
when King Bobo appears.  As a standalone track, honestly not too interesting.

'Mus_Wetlands_Vault_EdenBoss_Start (Mus_Scripted_Wetlands_Vault_EdenBoss=Mus_Wetlands_Vault_EdenBoss_Fake_On).txtp'
Michael McCann, possibly / The Rampager Emerges / Graveward Guardian Fake-Out
I believe this is from the Guardian fight right before Graveward.  As a
fun note, this and the `Mus_Scripted_City_Vault_Boss=Phase_01` track share
some DNA, and even have almost identical-sounding endings.  I'm pretty sure
that this one is sort of a continuation of the other one, and that they're both
probably McCann tracks (even though this one's from Eden-6).

'Play_Mus_NekroMystery (Mus_NekroMystery=Cemetery).txtp'
Julian Peterson, possibly / Secrets of Scryer's Crypt
Real subtle ambient type stuff; 4:30 long.  Pleasant enough if you're into it, but
maybe not really soundtrack-worthy?  After giving it an Actual Listen, I
think it'd make a nice counterpoint to the more bombastic stuff, though.

Video_ThePlan_Phase01.txtp
Video_ThePlan_Phase02.txtp
Video_ThePlan_Phase03.txtp
Backing tracks for Timothy's "The Plan" mission stuff.  Pretty fragmentary and
weird when taken out of context.

MUS_Town_Celebration.txtp
Silly little Irish-sounding jig (???, srsly) at the end of DLC3.  Not
really worth soundtracking, IMO.

MUS_Town_PlayerPiano_Damaged.txtp
Just a little broken piano key-mashing.

MUS_KreigCell_SkaTrack.txtp
Freddie Reid, John Robert Beck, Tim Hutton, and William Arthur / Buster Two Tone (Lite)
I remembered this in-game as sounding a lot more dour and weird, but it's
not at all bad on its own outside of it.  I prefer the non-lite version,
but that's what's in the game.

Julian Peterson, possibly / Gehenna at Sunrise
Doesn't actually show up in any TXTPs; real nice piano-based atmosphere,
though.
