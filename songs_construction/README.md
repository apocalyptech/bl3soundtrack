Just a collection of scripts and notes that I'd used to construct a
personal-use unofficial soundtrack named "Borderlands 3: The Songs".
This basically includes all the songs catalogued in the main post
which *aren't* part of the Crimson Radio set.  (So: intro/outro
cinematics, credits, Ellie's "Project DD" playlist, the Baby Dancer
track, and VR-0N1CA's electroswing dance track).  I may put together
something for Crimson Radio as well, but these were the ones I
actually wanted to get together.

I used the raw game audio for nearly all of these, and the construction
process (using ww2ogg/ReVorb/mp3splt/ffmpeg/vorbisgain/vorbiscomment)
should result in a soundtrack which doesn't have any lossy re-encodes.
The audio data should be basically identical to the game files themselves.
My one exception for this was Caleb Hawley's "Wish You Were Mine," which
is quite fragmentary in the game data.  For that, I just grabbed the audio
from youtube and did a lossy re-encode to Ogg Vorbis.

My proposed tracklist, which IMO works quite well:

1. The Heavy / Put It on the Line
2. Sazz / Animal
3. Robert Edwards & Andrew Griffiths / Feathers
4. Sarah McIntosh and Thom Robson / Fighter
5. Max R. / Do It Like a Superstar! (Borderlands 3 mix, Apocalyptech edit)
6. Animal Fiction / Explosions
7. Sarah McIntosh and Thom Robson / Freaks and Superpowers
8. Alicia Keys / Girl On Fire
9. Robert Edwards ft. Little Violet / Puppet on a String
10. Dave Cleveland, Scott Dente, Ken Lewis, and Blair Masters / Slap Bracelet
11. Brad Marrapodi and Sarah McIntosh / Faster Than The Man
12. Parry Music / Push It Home
13. Animal Fiction / Hold On
14. The Creepshow / Blood Blood Blood
15. Sarah McIntosh and Thom Robson / Want It All
16. Caleb Hawley / Wish You Were Mine
17. Cage the Elephant / Trouble
18. Sarah McIntosh, Steve Williams, and Thom Robson / I Want to Be Loved (Epic Version)
19. Robert Edwards ft. Little Violet / PiSk Swing
20. Tyreen Calypso / Stealth Time!

Not gonna put a detailed HOWTO here, but the other `.txt` files and shell
scripts in here should point you in the right direction.
