Borderlands 3 Raw Audio Processing
==================================

This repo serves as a general dumping grounds for information that I've
collected about dealing with raw audio extracts from Borderlands 3.
The general purpose was that I'd already bought all the official
soundtracks, but wanted to know what music in the game *wasn't* present
on those soundtracks, and to put together some unofficial "companion"
soundtracks for my own personal purposes.

To do that, I needed to extract the audio, match the raw audio to the OST
tracks as well as I could, and then categorize the remaining music tracks.

This is a ridiculous repo which just serves to house the backend markdown
used in this Reddit post:

[`https://www.reddit.com/r/borderlands3/comments/ospmu0/bl3_nonsoundtrackd_real_song_index_crimson_radio/`](https://www.reddit.com/r/borderlands3/comments/ospmu0/bl3_nonsoundtrackd_real_song_index_crimson_radio/)

Specifically, that's a mapping of raw (extracted) sound files to songs
which don't appear in the official BL3 soundtracks.  I wanted to store
that somewhere other than just Reddit, so here is the place.  If Reddit
ever goes belly-up or gets user-hostile, here's a backup of it.

The `songs_construction` dir also includes some notes about putting some
of these songs together into an unofficial soundtrack of sorts, and
includes a proposed tracklist which incorporates all non-Crimson-Radio
song tracks.
