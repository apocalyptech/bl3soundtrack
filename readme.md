This is a ridiculous repo which just serves to house the backend markdown
used in this Reddit post:

[`https://www.reddit.com/r/borderlands3/comments/ospmu0/bl3_nonsoundtrackd_real_song_index_crimson_radio/`](https://www.reddit.com/r/borderlands3/comments/ospmu0/bl3_nonsoundtrackd_real_song_index_crimson_radio/)

Specifically, that's a mapping of raw (extracted) sound files to songs
which don't appear in the official BL3 soundtracks.  I wanted to store
that somewhere other than just Reddit, so here is the place.  If Reddit
ever goes belly-up or gets user-hostile, here's a backup of it.

The `songs_construction` dir also includes some notes about putting some
of these songs together into an unofficial soundtrack of sorts, and
includes a proposed tracklist which incorporates all non-Crimson-Radio
song tracks.
